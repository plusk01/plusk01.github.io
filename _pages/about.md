I am a PhD candidate at MIT under the supervision of [Prof. Jonathan How](https://www.mit.edu/~jhow/) working in robotics and autonomous systems. My research focuses on solving challenging *data association* problems that frequently arise in fundamental estimation problems (e.g., localization, SLAM, calibration, multiple object tracking, multirobot map merging).

I received the M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (2018) and the B.S. in Electrical Engineering (2016) from Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, where I was advised by [Prof. Randy Beard](https://ece.byu.edu/directory/randy-beard).
