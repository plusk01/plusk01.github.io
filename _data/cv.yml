    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Aerospace Controls Lab, MIT
      year: 2018 - 2023
      description:
        - >
          Research in robust geometric perception and data association techniques for robotics. Developing algorithms
          (C++/Python) with applications to extrinsic sensor calibration, localization, mapping, loop closure and place
          recognition, and multiple object tracking. Algorithms demonstrated on heterogeneous teams of robots
          (multirotor and ground robot). Significant flight control development for multirotor and ground robot teams
          via on-board control and estimation. Open source contributor.

      description:
        - >
          Developed vision-based multiple object tracking algorithms (C++/Python) to detect moving objects in potential
          landing sites for emergency-landing of multirotors. Provided extensive hardware demonstrations and field
          tests of the complete system. Contributed to design and implementation of in-house research autopilot.
